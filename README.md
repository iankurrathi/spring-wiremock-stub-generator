## About
This is a tool for generating Wiremock stubs from Spring @Controller & @RestController annotated classes

TODO:
- add support for path arrays in mappings (currently we use only the first value in the array)
- add support for @RequestMapping on methods
- add support for @ResponseStatus on controller
- add instruction how to use the library to README
- fix Jacoco/Codecov
